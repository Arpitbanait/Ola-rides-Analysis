# Ola-rides-Analysis

 Project Overview
This project analyzes Ola Rides data to extract insights about ride trends, customer preferences, pricing, and driver performance. The goal is to explore, clean, visualize, and interpret the data to support business decisions such as optimizing routes, improving customer experience, and increasing operational efficiency.
Key Objectives
Perform data cleaning to handle missing, incorrect, or inconsistent entries.
Explore ride patterns by time, location, and type of service.
Analyze fare distribution and its relation to distance, duration, and time of day.
Identify peak hours and high-demand locations.
Visualize insights using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Provide actionable recommendations for operational improvements.
Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning & manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook – Analysis & reporting
Excel – Initial data exploration (optional)
Insights & Findings
Evening rides (5 PM – 9 PM) have the highest demand.
Airport routes generate higher average fares but longer wait times.
Weekends show 15–20% higher ride volume compared to weekdays.
Short-distance city rides make up over 60% of total bookings.
